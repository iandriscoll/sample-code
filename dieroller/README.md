## Overview

`"dieroller"` is a minimal [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package that
provides functions to simulate rolling a die.

  - `die()` creates a die object (of class `"die"`)
  - `roll()` rolls a die object, producing a `"roll"` object.
  - `plot()` method for a `"roll"` object to plot frequencies of rolls.
  - `summary()` method for a `"roll"` object.

## Motivation

This package has been developed to illustrate some of the concepts
behind the creation of an R package.
